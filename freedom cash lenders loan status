A secured loan is a type of debt backed by collateral, which is something you own, such as a house, car or savings account. There are different types of secured loans, but they all have one thing in common: If you fail to repay the loan, you can lose your asset.

How much you can borrow: Loan amounts vary with secured loans and are often determined by the value of the collateral. For example, a secured home loan, or mortgage, typically covers the value of the house minus your down payment. The same goes for an auto loan. A pawn lender puts a price on your property and loans that amount.
