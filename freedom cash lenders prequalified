If you default on a secured loan, the lender can repossess your asset, sometimes without notice. If your home goes into foreclosure, you may end up in court.

In addition to losing your collateral, your credit and finances could suffer for years. Here are some potential consequences:

Repossession or foreclosure on your credit report for up to seven years.

Difficulty accessing credit in the future.

Still owing money on repossessed assets.

Filing for bankruptcy to keep your property.
