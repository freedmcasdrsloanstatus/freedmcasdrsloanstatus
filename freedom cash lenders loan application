Banks, credit unions and online lenders offer secured loans. The lender typically reviews your collateral, credit and finances to determine your eligibility. The process often includes a hard credit inquiry, but some secured loans don't require it.

Most secured loans have fixed interest rates, meaning you'll repay the loan in equal monthly installments. If the lender reports payments to the three major credit bureaus, on-time payments will build your credit, but missed payments will damage it. After multiple missed payments, the lender can take your collateral.
